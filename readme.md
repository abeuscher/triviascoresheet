# Trivia Scoresheet

Work in progress. Using Docker, Next, and Mongoose with Mongo DB.

Todo:
 v1
    - Form validation / error feedback - done for login
    - Validate four parter - make sure answers do not equal each other before submit.
    - It would be nice to have some form of custom event trigger via chat. Like a class change or something to make shit go whoosh.

 v2
    - Video
    - Game creator / editor - for templates, custom questions, custom structure
    - Some API for multimedia questions
    - Multiple players on a team (figure out how to manage controls)
    - Add "buzzer" for lightning round (would be a fun finisher and a way to actually award prizes)
    - Could also do this through chat rather than video - fire text questions at players and show their answers in real time to audience.
