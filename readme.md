# Trivia Scoresheet

Work in progress. Using Docker, Next, and Mongoose with Mongo DB.

Dependencies:
- Docker
- NPM

To Install:

1. Add .env, appclient/src/env.js, appserver/dist/env.js
2. docker-compose up -d
3. yarn buildclient

Wishlist
- Video
- Game creator / editor - for templates, custom questions, custom structure
- Some API for multimedia questions
- Multiple players on a team (figure out how to manage controls)
- Add "buzzer" for lightning round (would be a fun finisher and a way to actually award prizes)
- Could also do this through chat rather than video - fire text questions at players and show their answers in real time to audience.
